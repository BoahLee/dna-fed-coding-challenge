# Front End Developer Coding Challenge

Hi there! Thank you for your interest in this role, and taking the time to undertake this coding challenge. ðŸ™‚ 

## What we're looking for

We're interested to see how you would build the design included in this repo using HTML, CSS and Javascript, and in particular: 

- That you write clean, structured, semantic html.
- Your approach to writing, and knowledge of CSS, including the use of modern features where appropriate.
- You have a strong attention to detail and can replicate designs.
- You can deliver a sound responsive experience across all device sizes from the design provided.
- Your work demonstrates efficiency and best practice, while keeping things simple where possible.

We don't want you to spend too much of your own time to complete this - provide whatever you feel can represent your current FE skill-set within a reasonable effort.

## Please note

- Copy for the page can be found in `data.json` in the `/assets/js/` subfolder. You are not required to consume the data from this file and may copy into your markup as appropriate. 
- There is a carousel/gallery included in a section within the design. You are not required to write the functionality and may select a plugin to use. 
- You may or may not have access to Sketch. A basic "UI Kit" is also provided, together with an image of the design. We don't expect complete pixel perfect spacing between elements. 
- This challenge is set up to use [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/), which is a zero config application bundler. You aren't required to use this, please use whatever configuration (if at all) that you are comfortable with. If you have any issue with the set up please advise.

## Getting started

Please fork the repository to you personal Github account. After you have forked the repo, clone your forked version to your machine. 

Install the project dependencies:

`npm install`

Then start a local server:

`npm run dev`

## When completed

Please commit and push any work to your Github account and provide a link. 

If for any reason you cannot, or choose not to follow this process for any reason, please provide a compressed folder of your working files less any files and sub directories listed in the gitignore. 

Thanks, and good luck!
